FloatPHP **Skeleton App** .

FloatPHP is a lightweight Micro PHP Framework designed with a clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach and built around the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Perfect for developing high-performance web applications tailored for **small** to **medium-sized** projects.

Developed entirely from scratch, this framework draws inspiration from industry-leading technologies such as **Zend**, **Symfony**, **Laravel**, **WordPress**, **Prestashop** and **Drupal**, combining their best features into a streamlined and efficient solution.
